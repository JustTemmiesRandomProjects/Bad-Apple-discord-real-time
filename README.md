this is the source code for the performance you can see in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fX_qBdS1gnc



THS IS API ABUSE! i used 30 bots to circumvent discord's rate limit, i ran this once to test it, and once to record it - making the effects on discord's servers negligible. i would not recommend deploying this permanently as you're practically begging for your account to be suspended.



if you for some ungodly reason want to use this replace the 'token' at the bottom of every file with your own bot tokens (yes, you really do need 30 bots, which can he tedious as discord will rate limit you quite quickly)

and then download the indevidual frames using from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GPzS23quhUo8qS73kn_qPTMLgvgycYHe/view and then create a folder named "frames" and inside THAT folder create "frameframe", then paste the files from google drive

you then need to rename all of the frames to remove the number and re add it without the zeros. this can be done with software like, for example https://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk/Download.php
